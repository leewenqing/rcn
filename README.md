## Recurrent Neural Networks as Central Pattern Generators
In our [previous repository](https://github.com/vliu15/CPG-RL), we explored various models that could improve upon the baseline Multilayer Perceptron policy baseline. We found that Recurrent Neural Networks work pretty well and intend to explore the recurrent architecture in depth in this repository.
